#summary CodeStyle for Opensource Game Studio projects.

= Introduction =

All listed requirements either add new requirements, or override existing ones of [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Google C++ style guide]. Therefore you should first read Google C++ style guide.

= Naming =
== General Naming Rules ==

It's best to name correctly, unambiguously and without abbreviation if possible. Though, if file scope is pretty small, we don't mind abbreviations
{{{
OGOFilmInfoPage *mFIP; // Ok in a small scope file.
}}}

== File Names ==

Header C++ files have .h extension (not hpp).

Source files one have .cpp (not cxx, not cc).

File names with C++ classes are named in the same way as classes:

{{{
TileStateMoving.h/TileStateMoving.cpp for TileStateMoving class.
}}}

We don't use underscores in file names.

Lower case is allowed only in special cases:
{{{
endian.h // For endian convertions
}}}
