#summary CodeStyle for Opensource Game Studio projects.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

All listed requirements either add new requirements, or override existing ones of [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Google C++ style guide]. Therefore you should first read Google C++ style guide.

= Naming =
== General naming rules ==

It's best to name correctly, unambiguously and without abbreviation if possible. Though, if file scope is pretty small, we don't mind abbreviations
{{{
OGOFilmInfoPage *mFIP; // Ok in a small scope file.
}}}

== File names ==

Header C++ files have .h extension (not hpp).

Source files one have .cpp (not cxx, not cc).

File names with C++ classes are named in the same way as classes:

{{{
TileStateMoving.h/TileStateMoving.cpp for TileStateMoving class.
}}}

We don't use underscores in file names.

Lower case is allowed only in special cases:
{{{
endian.h // For endian convertions
}}}

== Type names ==

Classes, structs, typedefs:
{{{
class TileStateMoving {
};

struct Item {
};

typedef std::vector<Item> Items;
}}}

Enums:
{{{
enum TILE_STATE {
  TS_MOVING,
  TS_HIDING
};
}}}

Enums should be located in Common.h like file, not nested into a class, if they are used in different files. Although, it's ok to nest Enum inside a private section if it's only used internally inside the class.

=== Variable names ===

Local variables and struct ones use camel case.

Class member variables start with 'm' and then camel case.

Global variables start with 'g' and then camel case.
{{{
int localVariable;
}}}
{{{
struct BinFormat {
  int           formatVersion;
  unsigned char formatMagic;
};
}}}
{{{
class TileStateMoving {
  private:
    int mMemberVariable;
};
}}}
{{{
TileStateMoving *gTileStateMoving;
}}}

=== Constant names ===
Uppercase with underscores:
{{{
const u16 MAX_STRLEN = 1024;
}}}

=== Function names ===

Function names use camel case and should be verbs:
{{{
void doSomethingSpecial()
}}}
{{{
class SomethingSpecial {
  public:
    void doItNow();
};
}}}
