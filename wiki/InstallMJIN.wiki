= Dependencies' versions =

MJIN-0.7 was built against the following versions of dependencies:

|| *Dependency* || *Version* || *Newer version works* ||
|| OIS || 1.2.0 || No ||
|| OGRE || 2310:90f4a002251d || No ||
|| CEGUI || 2498:ce3f1bd08b58 || No ||
|| OpenAL Soft || 1.4.272 || Yes ||
|| ALURE || 1.1 || Yes ||
|| CMake Linux || 2.6 || Yes ||
|| CMake Windows || 2.8.3 || No ||

= 1. Linux build environment setup (Debian 5.0.8 32/64-bit DVD1 install) =

== Install additional packages ==

Note: linux-headers is only necessary to compile VirtualBox additions, only after
installing additions do shared folders start to function.

Add the following to sources.list right after the DVD entry:

{{{
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian lenny main
}}}

Install necessary packages by running:

{{{
aptitude install \
    automake \
    cmake \
    freeglut3-dev \
    g++ \
    libexpat1-dev \
    libfreeimage-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev \
    libgl1-mesa-dev \
    linux-headers-`uname -r` \
    libopenal-dev \
    libpcre3-dev \
    libtool \
    libvorbis-dev \
    libxaw7-dev \
    libxrandr-dev \
    mercurial \
    make \
    rsync
}}}

== Download necessary files ==

Create a new directory *~/src*. Put MJIN-0.7 sources into there, go to *~/src/mjin-0.7/ext/linux* and run:

{{{
./download ~/src
}}}

It will download all files necessary to build MJIN-0.7 into *~/src*.

== Build all ==

While in the same directory (*ext/linux*), run

{{{
./install
}}}

It will build and install all necessary files, including MJIN-0.7, within *~/build*.

= 2. Windows build environment setup (XP 32-bit install) =

== CMake ==

Install [http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.3-win32-x86.exe CMake-2.8.3-win32-x86.exe]

At the *Install Options* screen select

 * Add CMake to the system PATH for all users
 * Create CMake Desktop Icon

== libsndfile ==

Install [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download libsndfile-1.0.21-w32-setup.exe] to default path.

== Add C:/MinGW/bin to %PATH% ==

You must do it before launching *install* script later.

== Cygwin ==

Install [http://cygwin.com/setup.exe Cygwin] without selecting additional
packages.

After that, install additional packages by running the following command:

{{{
setup.exe -P bz2,gz,mercurial,patch,rsync,subversion,vim,wget,unzip
}}}

It will run the same sequence of dialogs. Just keep on pressing "Next",
and it will install everything as needed.

Cygwin is used as a UNIX shell, and MinGW as a compiler.

== Download necessary files ==

Create a new directory *C:/src*. Put MJIN-0.7 sources into there, go to *C:/src/mjin-0.7/ext/cygwin* and run the script from within Cygwin shell:

{{{
./download C:/src
}}}

It will download all files necessary to build MJIN-0.7 into *C:/src*.

== Build all ==

While in the same directory (*ext/cygwin*), run

{{{
./install
}}}

It will build and install all necessary files, including MJIN-0.7, within *C:/build*.
