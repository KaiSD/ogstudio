#summary This is a collection of things that are imperfect for us

= CEGUI editors =
Outdated CELayoutEditor, CEImageEditor are:
  * hard to build (due to autotools).
  * editing inconveniences;
CEED is unusable for CEGUI 0.7 we use.

= CEGUI =

No keyboard focus support.

= C++ libraries in general =
CEGUI depends on OGRE and won't work with other builds of OGRE.
C libraries don't have that problem.

I wonder if it's possible to have C library with everything in it and a small C++ library ontop of it which each project will compile itself.

= OIS =

Nothing newer than OIS-1.2 works under Linux.

= Team =

If you want to join this project you need to invest time regularly, no less than several hours a week. If you can't afford that, you will only trick yourself into thinking of doing something. Please, don't do that, and don't give us false hope that we can count on you.

I (kornerr) has already passed that stage where you try to spend a few hours once in a month. This only makes you depressed. Only regular time investments can change the world we're trying to change.

We have a former team member that shared a technology demo of his liking to us and "wanted to work with us again". We assigned him quite a challenging and very interesting task. After contacting him in 1-2 months we learned he dropped it.
