#summary This is a collection of things that are imperfect for us

= CEGUI editors =
Outdated CELayoutEditor, CEImageEditor are:
* hard to build (due to autotools).
CEED is unusable for CEGUI 0.7 we use;
* editing inconveniences;


= CEGUI =

No keyboard focus support.

= C++ libraries in general =
CEGUI depends on OGRE and won't work with other builds of OGRE.
C libraries don't have that problem.

I wonder if it's possible to have C library with everything in it and a small C++ library ontop of it which each project will compile itself.

= OIS =

Nothing newer than OIS-1.2 works under Linux.
